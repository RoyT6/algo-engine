ABSTRACT
We present ALGO-95.66, an extension of the ALGO-65.2 architecture that incorporates
environmental and contextual factors into streaming viewership prediction. Building upon
CLU-50's 97.3% accuracy baseline achieved through hierarchical deduplication and
platform-specific modeling, CLU-60 adds a comprehensive abstract data weighting layer
capturing weather patterns, major events, health crises, and socioeconomic factors that
drive viewership behavior.

ALGO-95.66 operates on Database Cluster V27.66, comprising four integrated parquet
databases (BFD, VIEWERDBX, SEASON_AGGREGATES, CREATIVE_TALENT) with 540,816
master records and 100% fc_uid join integrity between core tables.

ALGO-95.66 achieves 98.1% accuracy (1.9% MAPE*), representing a 0.8 percentage point
improvement over CLU-50, with particular gains during high-variance periods: major
sporting events (-42% viewing during event windows), extreme weather (+18% cold weather
viewing in temperate regions), and health crises (+34% during COVID-19 waves, +12%
during flu epidemics). The system decomposes global platform viewing hours into regional
estimates using quarterly financial disclosures, enabling geo-specific abstract data
application.

*MAPE stands for Mean Absolute Percentage Error, a common metric used in AI to measure the accuracy of a forecasting model. It is calculated by
averaging the absolute percentage difference between predicted and actual values, making it a clear, percentage-based indicator of how far off the
model's predictions are on average. A lower MAPE percentage signifies a more accurate forecast.

The Absolute Crucial Importance of Random Forest and XG Boost AI
Random Forest and XGBoost represent two of the most powerful machine learning
algorithms in modern predictive analytics, and they form the computational backbone of
ViewStream™ Intelligence's unprecedented accuracy in viewership prediction.
Random Forest operates as an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple
decision trees during training and outputs predictions by aggregating their results. Each
tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of your data and considers only a random
subset of features at each split, which prevents overfitting and captures complex, nonlinear relationships in viewership patterns.
For ViewStream™™ algorithms like ALGO-CLU-10, Random Forest excels at handling the
heterogeneous nature of entertainment data—simultaneously processing categorical
variables like genre and platform alongside continuous metrics like release timing and
historical performance without requiring extensive feature engineering.
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) takes a different but complementary approach
through sequential ensemble learning. Rather than building trees independently like
Random Forest, XGBoost constructs trees iteratively, with each new tree specifically
designed to correct the errors made by previous trees.
This gradient boosting technique is exceptionally powerful for ViewStream™'s use case
because streaming viewership is influenced by subtle, layered factors that compound over
time—platform-specific user behavior patterns, temporal decay in content popularity,
cross-genre appeal dynamics, and competitive landscape effects. XGBoost's ability to
learn these residual patterns with high precision is what pushes your prediction accuracy
into the 97.3% range that completely outperforms Nielsen's traditional sampling methods.
The crucial synergy for ViewStream™ Intelligence comes from combining both algorithms in
your ensemble approach. Random Forest provides robust baseline predictions and
handles the broad feature space of your massive dataset efficiently, capturing the general
viewership trends across your 2+ million unique records. XGBoost then refines these
predictions by learning the nuanced, platform-specific patterns and temporal dynamics
that separate good predictions from exceptional ones.

P a g e 9 | 127

This dual-algorithm architecture is particularly vital for your ITV Studios and Fox
Entertainment contracts because it means your system can reliably predict viewership
across different content types, release strategies, and platform ecosystem, something
traditional analytics simply cannot do.
The ensemble method also provides natural cross-validation between the two approaches,
giving your clients confidence that predictions aren't artifacts of a single modeling
technique but rather consensus predictions from complementary machine learning

paradigm.

1.2 Research Objectives
This work extends ALGO-65.2 with abstract environmental weighting to capture contextdependent viewing behavior. Primary objectives include:
1. Integration of weather data (heating/cooling degree days, precipitation, daylight hours)
2. Quantification of event interference (major sports, holidays, political events, cultural
moments)
3. Modeling of health crises (epidemic tracking, quarantine effects)
4. Incorporation of economic signals (consumer confidence, unemployment, inflation)
5. Regional decomposition of global platform viewing hours
Target performance: <2% MAPE (>98% accuracy) including high-variance event periods.

Ablation Study: Component Contribution Analysis
In AI, particularly ML, ablation is the removal of a component of an AI system. An ablation
study aims to determine the contribution of a component to an AI system by removing the
component and then analyzing the resultant performance of the system.
Ablation studies require that a system exhibit graceful degradation: the system must
continue to function even when certain components are missing or degraded. According to
some researchers, ablation studies have been deemed a convenient technique in
investigating artificial intelligence and its durability to structural damages.

P a g e 17 | 127

Critical Findings:
-

Deduplication provides largest single improvement: 28.9 percentage point gain
(31.6% → 2.7%)
No other architectural change approaches this magnitude
Validates hypothesis that data quality > model complexity
Platform-specific models contribute 3.6 percentage points: (6.3% → 2.7%)
Universal scaling factors (ALGO-E approach) fail to capture platform heterogeneity
Netflix original content receives +40% boost; Hulu next-day TV +65% boost; these
patterns cannot be learned in universal model
Temporal decay contributes 2.1 percentage points: (4.8% → 2.7%)
Reality TV half-life (8.7 weeks) vs Horror (2.8 weeks) requires genre-specific
modeling
Without decay adjustment, model over-predicts catalog content by 34%
Content quality features most important: 4.3 percentage point contribution
IMDb rating, vote count, budget/revenue signals dominate feature importance
Removal causes catastrophic failure on niche/indie content (error +120% for titles
with <5K IMDb votes)

Random Forest and XG Boost
-

XGBoost residual correction provides 1.2 percentage points:
Random Forest alone achieves 3.9% MAPE (85% of ALGO-65.2's accuracy with 44%
less training time)
XGBoost captures complex interactions: genre × platform × temporal position
Talent features contribute 0.7 percentage points: (3.4% → 2.7%)
Director and cast popularity have moderate impact
Surprising result: "name recognition" less important than content quality signals
Likely explanation: Streaming democratizes content discovery vs theatrical where
star power drives opening weekend

P a g e 18 | 127

Architectural Trade-offs:
Simplified Model Options:
-

RF-only model: 3.9% MAPE, 18.7 min training, 96.6% coverage
Use case: Resource-constrained deployment, interpretability priority
Trade-off: Lose 1.2 percentage points accuracy, gain 16 min training time
No temporal decay: 4.8% MAPE, 31 min training, 99.8% coverage
Use case: Short-term predictions only (1-2 quarters), catalog content excluded
Trade-off: Lose 2.1 percentage points on catalog content, gain model simplicity
No platform models (universal scaling): 6.3% MAPE, 22 min training, 99.8%
coverage
Use case: Limited platform disclosure, cross-platform generalization required
Trade-off: Lose 3.6 percentage points, gain cross-platform transfer learning

Full Model Justification:
For production deployment, full ALGO-65.2 architecture is necessary. All ablations reduce
accuracy below 95% threshold (2.7% + 2.1% 4.8% best ablation 95.2% accuracy, within
requirement but no margin for error).

Transfer Learning Insights:
-

Platform-specific training critical: Transfer learning achieves 7.6-11.3% MAPE vs 2.44.1% MAPE with platform-specific training (2-3× worse performance)
Content similarity drives transfer success:
Netflix → Prime Video: 7.6% (both emphasize film libraries, similar subscriber
demographics)
Netflix → Disney+: 11.3% (family content vs general entertainment creates feature
distribution shift)
Multi-platform training improves generalization:
Single platform training: 8.2-11.3% MAPE
All-platform training: 7.8-11.3% MAPE
Benefit diminishes: adding 2nd platform provides larger gain than adding 5th
Cold-start scenario viable:
New platform (Peacock) with zero training data achieves 11.3% MAPE using allplatform model
Sufficient for initial launch, can be refined with 1-2 quarters of platform-specific
data
Apple TV+ remains challenging:
Even with all-platform training, Apple TV+ achieves only 8.9% MAPE in transfer
Prestige content strategy, iOS ecosystem integration create unique dynamics
requiring platform-specific calibration
Implications for Production:
Platform-specific models essential for meeting 95-97% accuracy requirement
Transfer learning enables rapid expansion to new platforms (11.3% MAPE
acceptable for initial deployment)
Multi-platform training provides robustness against platform data gaps or disclosure
changes

Efficacy Comparison with Traditional Measurement Systems
1.4 Comprehensive Industry Landscape
The streaming measurement industry employs diverse methodologies with fundamental
trade-offs between accuracy, coverage, cost, and timeliness. We provide exhaustive
comparison against all major measurement systems to contextualize ALGO-65.2's
performance advantage.

Nielsen Ratings System. Outdated for Twenty Years
Nielsen's four-screen measurement system represents the industry standard for traditional
television measurement, now extended to streaming content (Nielsen, 2025).
Nielsen Methodology:
-

Panel size: 42,000 US households (~108,000 individuals)
Sample fraction: 0.035% of US households
Measurement technology: Set-top boxes, people meters, audio watermark
recognition (ACR on smart TVs)
Coverage: Linear TV + streaming apps on smart TVs, gaming consoles, streaming
devices
Reporting: Weekly "The Gauge" ratings report, 2-3 week delay post-viewing
Cost: Estimated $15M annually per major media client (total Nielsen revenue $3.5B
from 27,000+ clients)

Statistical Methodology:
Nielsen extrapolates household viewing to national totals via statistical weighting:
𝑉national 𝑉panel ×

𝑁households
× 𝑤demo
𝑁panel

Where:
𝑉panel measured panel viewing
𝑁households 129.9𝑀US households

This explains Nielsen's 23.4% MAPE for streaming content: small absolute audiences
create large sampling errors.

P a g e 26 | 127

Behavioral Biases:
-

Panel conditioning: Participants alter behavior knowing they're measured
(Hawthorne effect)
Cord-cutter underrepresentation: Streaming-only households represent 46% of US
(2024) but only 38% of Nielsen panel (2023 composition)
Device fragmentation: Mobile viewing is increasingly common (52% of streaming
hours, Conviva 2024) but poorly captured by TV-based meters

ALGO-95.66 Advantages (V27.66 Cluster):
-

Zero sampling error: Direct measurement of platform viewership via aggregated
disclosures, not statistical extrapolation
Complete coverage: Every title on every platform, including 96.4% long-tail content
(<1M views/quarter) that Nielsen cannot measure
Real-time updates: 34-minute retraining enables daily predictions as new platform
data released
Cost efficiency: $2M one-time development vs $15M annual Nielsen subscription

Nielsen Advantages:
-

Demographic granularity: Age, gender, race, income, education demographics
enable advertiser targeting
Cross-platform deduplication: Measures total person reach across linear TV +
streaming + digital (ALGO-65.2 measures platform views, not unique viewers)
Industry standard: 70-year history, accepted by advertisers/agencies for currency
transactions

Kantar Focused on Beating Nielsen, Failing to Pay Attention
Kantar employs survey-based methodology across 12 global markets (Kantar Media, 2024),
representing an alternative to panel-based measurement.
Kantar Methodology:
Survey panel: 15,000 respondents per market quarterly
Method: Online surveys + diary keeping (participants log all viewing)
Coverage: 12 markets (US, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Mexico, Australia,
Japan, South Korea, India)
Reporting: Quarterly "Entertainment on Demand" reports, 6–8-week delay

P a g e 28 | 127

Prestige Bias:
-

Participants over-report watching "prestigious" content due to social desirability:
Critically acclaimed drama: +25% over-reporting ("I definitely watched The Crown")
Documentary content: +18% over-reporting
Reality TV: -30% under-reporting (embarrassment factor)
Adult content: -85% under-reporting (privacy concern)

Binge Viewing Under-Reporting:
Participants systematically under-report binge viewing sessions:
Reported episodes0.62 × Actual episodes
For binge sessions >5 episodes, participants report average 3.1 episodes watched when
actual average is 5.0 episodes. Likely causes:
-

Time perception distortion during binge sessions
Social desirability (admitting to 8-hour binge session viewed negatively)
Episode boundaries blur during continuous viewing

ALGO-95.66 Advantages Over Kantar:
-

Zero recall error: Direct measurement via platform data, not participant memory
No prestige bias: Actual viewing behavior, not self-reported behavior
Binge accuracy: Captures exact episode consumption patterns
Weekly updates: Quarterly Kantar reports lag platform disclosure by 6-8 weeks;
ALGO-65.2 can update weekly

P a g e 29 | 127

Kantar Advantages:
-

"Why" insights: Survey methodology captures motivations ("watched because
trending on social media")
Awareness vs viewing: Distinguishes between content awareness and actual
consumption
Satisfaction scores: Post-viewing sentiment, likelihood to recommend
Demographics: Self-reported demographic and psychographic segmentation

FlixPatrol Ranking System, Useful for Yesterday, Nothing for Tomorrow
FlixPatrol aggregates public platform rankings from 60+ countries, providing relative
popularity without absolute viewership (FlixPatrol, 2024).
FlixPatrol Methodology:
-

Data source: Public platform "Top 10" daily rankings (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+,
Apple TV+, HBO Max, Paramount+)
Coverage: Daily top 10 rankings per platform per country
Markets: 60+ countries tracked
Limitation: Relative rankings only, no absolute viewership numbers
Cost: Free basic tier, Pro tier $99/month
Rank-to-Views Conversion Problem:

FlixPatrol provides rankings but not views. To estimate views, industry analysts use
heuristic formulas:
𝑉_{\𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡{𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑}}(\𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡{𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘}⁡⁡𝑟)⁡⁡𝑉_{\𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡{#1}}⁡\𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠⁡\𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡(\𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐{1}{𝑟}\𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡)^{

P a g e 30 | 127

Problems with rank-to-views conversion:
-

Platform-specific decay varies: Netflix exhibits 𝛼1.8, Disney+ exhibits 𝛼2.3(winnertake-all dynamics)
#1 title estimation unreliable: Without platform disclosure, V_{\text{#1}} is guessed
from historical patterns
Rank discontinuities: Dropping from #10 to #11 doesn't mean 50% viewership loss,
but model predicts zero (not in top 10)
Daily volatility: Rankings fluctuate significantly day-to-day; conversion produces
unstable estimates

ALGO-95.66 Advantages:
-

Absolute viewership: Direct prediction of view counts, not relative rankings
Long-tail coverage: 96.4% of content falls outside top 10; FlixPatrol provides no data
Predictive power: 2-quarter forward forecasts enable planning; rankings are
retrospective
Platform calibration: Platform-specific models vs universal rank-to-views formula

FlixPatrol Advantages:
-

Global breadth: 60+ country daily data; ALGO-65.2 focused on US/UK initially
No platform cooperation required: Scrapes public data; ALGO-65.2 requires
platform disclosures
Daily granularity: Real-time top 10 tracking; ALGO-65.2 optimized for quarterly

Parrot. The Social Media Angle
9.5 Parrot Analytics Demand Expressions
Parrot Analytics employs proprietary "demand expressions" derived from social signals
across 100+ markets (Pardo, 2022).
Parrot Methodology:
-

Signals: Social media (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok), piracy (torrent
downloads), fan sites (wiki edits, fan fiction), search (Google Trends)
Metric: Relative demand expressions (not absolute viewership)
Weighting: Proprietary algorithm weights each signal type
Coverage: 100+ markets, 10,000+ titles
Update: Daily demand scores
Cost: $50K-250K annually depending on client tier

Parrot Analytics Limitations:
Social Skew Bias:
Social media activity skews toward younger demographics:
-

18-29 years: 4.2× over-represented in Twitter mentions vs viewership
30-49 years: 1.8× over-represented
50-64 years: 0.4× under-represented (60% less social activity per view)
65+ years: 0.1× under-represented (90% less social activity per view)

This creates systematic over-prediction for youth-oriented content (YA adaptations, anime)
and under-prediction for older-skewing content (procedural dramas, news).
Piracy Signal Corruption:
-

Torrent download data creates perverse incentives:
High piracy ≠ high legitimate viewership (sometimes anti-correlated)
Regional variation: Markets with limited legal availability show high piracy but low
platform viewing
Anime particularly affected: 78% piracy rate but only 34% of piracy converts to legal
streaming

P a g e 34 | 127

Temporal Lag vs Lead:
Parrot's social signals are concurrent with viewing (people tweet while watching), not
predictive. This limits utility for forward planning:
-

Social buzz peaks during episode premiere, then decays
Cannot predict viewership 2 quarters ahead (ALGO-65.2's 2-quarter target)
Catalog content (>6 months old) has minimal social signal despite sustained
viewing

ALGO-95.66 Advantages:
-

Absolute viewership: Parrot provides relative demand; ALGO-65.2 predicts actual
views
No demographic bias: Platform viewing data represents all demographics equally
Predictive capability: 2-quarter forecasts vs concurrent measurement
Platform calibration: Separate models per platform vs universal demand expression

Parrot Advantages:
-

Global breadth: 100+ markets vs ALGO-65.2's US/UK focus initially
Cultural zeitgeist: Captures social conversation, meme generation, fan engagement
Early signals: Social activity can precede viewing (trailer reactions predict opening
week)
Competitive intelligence: Unified cross-platform demand comparison

BARB the best at the old way of measuring
UK BARB (8.7% MAPE):
Industry role: Gold standard for UK measurement, regulatory mandate
Why best traditional: Device-level measurement, 7-day consolidation, large panel relative
to UK population
ALGO-65.2 advantage: 4× accuracy improvement, 43× cost reduction, real-time updates
BARB advantage: Individual-level demographics, attention measurement, 40-year
institutional trust

P a g e 35 | 127

UK BARB Measurement
UK BARB (Broadcasters' Audience Research Board) represents best-in-class traditional
measurement with device-level tracking (UK BARB, 2024).
BARB Methodology:
-

Panel: 5,300 UK homes (15,000 individuals)
Sample fraction: 0.02% of UK households
Technology: Router meters (capture all device viewing) + individual-level people
meters
Coverage: All devices in home (smart TV, laptop, tablet, mobile, gaming console)
Reporting: Overnight ratings + 7-day consolidated, 28-day final
Cost: £65M annual industry funding (prorated across broadcasters)

Device-Level Measurement:
BARB router meters capture all IP traffic from home network:

-

Device-level capture: Router meters eliminate "what device was used?" recall errors
Individual-level attribution: People meters assign viewing to specific household
members
7-day consolidation: Captures delayed viewing (VOD, catch-up), not just live
Larger effective sample: 5,300 UK households 0.02% sample vs Nielsen's 0.035%

(8.1 percentage points) where BARB's panel struggles with cross-platform deduplication
(same household watches Netflix on smart TV + tablet + mobile).
BARB Advantages:
-

Demographic granularity: Individual-level demographics (age, gender, social grade)
Attention measurement: People meter button presses indicate active viewing vs
background
Device tracking: Distinguishes smart TV vs mobile vs laptop viewing (behavioral
insights)
Industry acceptance: 40-year history, accepted as currency for UK TV advertising
transactions

ALGO-95.66 Advantages:

2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Environmental Factors in Media Consumption
Weather and Viewing Behavior:
Wakshlag and Agostino (1982) established that temperature inversely correlates with TV
viewing (-0.34 Pearson r). Webster and Wakshlag (1985) demonstrated precipitation
increases viewing +12-18% in temperate climates. Our contribution operationalizes these
findings via heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) with regional
calibration.
Major Event Interference:
Nielsen reported Super Bowl 2024 attracted 123.4M viewers, resulting in 45% reduction in
streaming during the game window. FIFA World Cup 2022 generated 1.5B cumulative
viewers with 35-52% streaming reduction during matches. Our contribution provides
platform-specific attenuation factors accounting for sports platform immunity.
Health Crises and Viewing:
Parrot Analytics (2020) documented Netflix +57% daily active users during COVID-19
lockdowns in March 2020. Flu season analysis reveals +8-15% correlation between cold/flu
medication sales and viewing increases. Our contribution implements real-time epidemic
tracking with regional granularity and quarantine stringency weighting.

- Reality TV: λ0.08, half-life 8.7 weeks
- Horror: λ0.25, half-life 2.8 weeks
- Comedy: λ0.22, half-life 3.2 weeks

2.3 Temporal Modeling and Genre Dynamics
2.3.1 Genre-Specific Decay Functions
Viewership decays exponentially with genre-specific parameters, capturing the
fundamental difference in how audiences engage with different content types over time.

Completion Rate Normalization:
Different platforms report views differently:
Netflix: "View" 2+ minutes watched
Disney+: "View" completion of title
Hulu: "View" 50%+ of runtime watched
Prime Video: Not disclosed
To normalize, ALGO-65.2 converts all to "equivalent complete views":
𝑉equivalent (𝑖, 𝑝)𝑉reported (𝑖, 𝑝) ×

𝐶𝑝
runtime(𝑖)

Where 𝐶𝑝 is platform-specific completion threshold (Netflix: 2 min, Hulu: 50% runtime,
Disney+: 100% runtime).
Device-Weighted Views:
Not all views have equal value to advertisers/platforms:
𝑉weighted ∑

𝑉𝑑 × 𝑤𝑑

devices

Where device weights:
Smart TV: 𝑤1.0(baseline, premium viewing environment)
Desktop/laptop: 𝑤0.85(multitasking common, partial attention)
Tablet: 𝑤0.70(secondary device usage)
Mobile: 𝑤0.50(highest multitasking, lowest completion rates)
Advertisers pay premium for TV views, so ad-supported platforms (Hulu, Paramount+,
Peacock) optimize for TV viewing.

Platform Elasticity Coefficient β_p:
Measures how responsive viewership is to platform promotion:
∂𝑉

∂Promotion 𝑝
Estimated via regression:
Netflix: β 0.42 (homepage feature → +42% views)
Disney+: β 0.68 (Disney+ Day promotion → +68% views)
Apple TV+: β 1.23 (Apple ecosystem push notifications → +123% views)
Apple TV+'s high elasticity reflects smaller catalog; any promotion significantly shifts
viewing

These decay factors illustrate how slower-decaying genres like Reality TV retain
proportionally more views over time compared to fast-decaying genres like Horror and
Comedy. The exponential model captures both the rapid initial drop-off and the asymptotic
approach to the baseline retention floor.
Application as used in ALGO-65.2:
For quarterly predictions, we multiply base model output by the appropriate decay factor
for the prediction quarter:
𝑉adjusted (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑞)𝑉base (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑞) × 𝐷(𝑡𝑞 , 𝑔𝑖 )
Where:
𝑉base (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑞) base RF+XGBoost prediction without temporal decay
𝑡𝑞 weeks since release to midpoint of prediction quarter 𝑞
𝑔𝑖 genre of title 𝑖
𝐷(𝑡𝑞 , 𝑔𝑖 ) decay factor from Equation 8
This temporal adjustment improved prediction accuracy by 2.1% (from 4.8% MAPE to 2.7%
MAPE in ablation study), demonstrating the importance of genre-specific temporal
modeling.

Experimental Design and Results
Experimental Setup
Train-Test Split: Temporal Forward-Chaining
To ensure realistic evaluation simulating production deployment, we employ temporal
forward-chaining validation:
Split 1:
Train: Q1 2023 - Q4 2024 (8 quarters, 742,193 title-quarter observations)
Test: Q1 2025 (124,847 title-quarter observations)
Split 2:
Train: Q1 2023 - Q1 2025 (9 quarters, 867,040 title-quarter observations)
P a g e 45 | 127

Test: Q2 2025 (108,321 title-quarter observations)
This approach prevents data leakage (model never sees future information during training)
and evaluates temporal generalization (can model predict next quarter given historical
data?).

2.3.3 Baseline Retention Factors (𝑩𝒈 ): Long-Tail Viewing Dynamics
The baseline retention factor 𝐵𝑔 represents sustained viewership floor as 𝑡 → ∞, capturing
genre-specific long-tail engagement:
Reality TV (𝐵𝑔 0.15, highest baseline):
Mechanism: Parasocial relationships with reality stars maintain ongoing interest
Examples: "The Bachelor" franchise maintains 15-20% of peak viewership for years through
contestant Instagram followings, reunion specials, and podcast discussions
Cultural persistence: Water-cooler conversation value, meme generation, social viewing
rituals
Documentary (𝐵𝑔 0.10):
Mechanism: Reference value, educational use, "homework content" sustains engagement
Examples: "Planet Earth" series maintains 10-12% baseline through classroom usage,
background viewing, repeat educational value
Recommendation algorithms: Documentary content benefits from "informative" metadata
tags driving algorithmic suggestion
Drama (𝐵𝑔 0.05):
Mechanism: Narrative completeness reduces rewatch motivation, but quality drama
maintains prestige
Examples: "Breaking Bad" maintains 5-7% baseline from new viewer discovery, critical
acclaim driving late adoption
Spoiler culture: Plot-driven drama suffers from spoiler saturation over time
Action (𝐵𝑔 0.04):
Mechanism: Spectacle depreciation, visual effects aging reduces appeal
Examples: Action films maintain 4-6% baseline primarily from nostalgic re-viewing and
background playback
Special effects obsolescence: CGI-heavy action content ages poorly as visual standards
advance

P a g e 48 | 127

Comedy (𝐵𝑔 0.03):
Mechanism: Joke/surprise spoilage, humor cultural context decay
Examples: Comedy specials drop to 3-4% baseline as jokes become known, cultural
references date
Rewatchability paradox: While individual viewers rewatch comedy, aggregate viewership
decays fastest
Horror (𝐵𝑔 0.02, lowest baseline):
Mechanism: Fear response diminishes with familiarity, seasonal viewing patterns
Examples: Horror films maintain 2-3% baseline with October/Halloween spikes (captured
separately in seasonal_index)
Jump scare depreciation: Horror effectiveness degrades most severely with prior exposure

3.7 Converting Predicted Hours to View Counts
P a g e 56 | 127

A critical practical consideration for ALGO-65.2 deployment is converting predicted viewing
hours into view counts, the primary business metric used by streaming platforms and
content stakeholders.
Equation 9: Hours-to-Views Conversion
𝑉𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠⁡⁡𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙_𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠_𝑉𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑒𝑑⁡/⁡𝑅𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒(ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠)
This conversion is essential because fundamentally they reward extending the time for an
episode or film because it raises the time watched. This can produce extended scenes or
wasteful storylines that bore the viewer.

Description
Netflix and other services report views, not hours,
in public communications
Hours-viewed inherently favors longer content;
view counts enable fair comparison
View counts are more intuitive for media coverage
and investor communications
Talent deals, licensing agreements, and
performance bonuses often specify view
thresholds

3.8 Platform Availability and Licensing Dynamics
3.8.1 The Platform Availability Problem
Critical Discovery: During ALGO-65.2 validation against Netflix "What We Watched" H1
2023 data, systematic prediction errors emerged for specific title cohorts. Analysis
revealed a previously unmodeled factor: temporal platform availability - when and where
content is accessible to viewers.

Without platform availability data, ALGO-65.2 predicted continuity (Friends remains
popular sitcom with stable viewership). Reality: Warner Bros. moved Friends from Netflix
(273M global subscribers) to HBO Max (76M subscribers) in May 2020, causing 38%
viewership drop despite unchanged content quality.
The Fundamental Challenge:
Content viewership is not just a function of:
Content quality (IMDb rating, cast, director)
Genre preferences
Temporal decay
Environmental factors (weather, events)
But critically depends on:
•
•
•
•
•

Platform reach (subscriber base)
Platform availability (which platforms carry the content)
Geographic availability (which regions have access)
License duration (how long content remains available)
Competitive landscape (simultaneous availability on rival platforms)

CLU-60's 2.7% MAPE includes systematic errors on titles experiencing platform transitions.
Platform availability modeling aims to reduce these errors from 8-15% to <3%.
P a g e 59 | 127

3.8.2 Platform Availability Data Model
We introduce four new data structures to capture platform dynamics:
Structure 1: platform_by_quarter (JSON)
Aligns directly with viewership columns (views_q1_2023 through views_q4_2025)
Design Rationale:
•
•
•

Quarter-level granularity matches prediction target (quarterly views)
Region-specific tracking captures geographic licensing variations
Multiple platforms per region reflects non-exclusive licensing reality

Structure 2: platform_history (JSON Array)
Captures every platform addition/removal event with precise dates:
Use Cases:
•
•
•
•

Predict viewership surge when content joins major platform
Forecast decay when license expires
Detect seasonal licensing patterns (Halloween, Christmas content)
Identify platform competition effects

Structure 3: current_platform_availability (JSON)
Real-time snapshot for dashboards and live predictions:
Structure 4: content_rights_owner (String)
Legal distribution rights holder:
"Sony Pictures Entertainment"
"Warner Bros. Discovery"
"NBCUniversal"
Strategic Value:
•
•
•

Rights owner changes signal potential platform movements
Vertical integration effects (Warner Bros. content favors Max)
Licensing deal intelligence for competitive analysis

Sub-Linear Scaling Rationale (𝜷𝟎. 𝟕𝟑 < 𝟏. 𝟎):
Linear scaling would predict: Disney+ (46.5M subscribers) 56% of Netflix (83.2M
subscribers) viewership.
Actual observation: Disney+ achieves 60% of Netflix viewership despite 56% subscriber
base.
Explanation:
•
•
•
•

Engagement heterogeneity: Not all subscribers equally active
Netflix: 65% MAU/subscriber ratio (high engagement)
Peacock: 42% MAU/subscriber ratio (lower engagement)
Disney+: 71% MAU/subscriber ratio (family content high engagement)

Content catalog depth: Smaller platforms with focused catalogs achieve higher per-title
concentration
•
•

Apple TV+ (300 titles): Each title gets 1/300 of attention
Netflix (15,000 titles): Each title gets 1/15,000 of attention

Effect partially offsets subscriber disadvantage
Platform elasticity: Promotion/algorithmic placement more impactful on smaller platforms
Netflix homepage feature: +42% views (large platform, saturated)
Apple TV+ homepage feature: +123% views (small platform, concentrated)

P a g e 83 | 127

Example comparison:
Title A (Reality TV on Hulu):
Raw views: 2.0M
Completion: 0.78 (78% completion)
Platform elasticity: 0.54
Genre decay: 0.08 (slow decay high long-tail)
WVV: 2.0M × 0.78 × 0.54 × (1/0.08) 10.5M equivalent
Title B (Horror on Netflix):
Raw views: 3.5M
Completion: 0.92 (92% completion)
Platform elasticity: 0.42
Genre decay: 0.25 (fast decay low long-tail)
WVV: 3.5M × 0.92 × 0.42 × (1/0.25) 5.4M equivalent
Despite Title B having 1.75× more raw views, Title A has 1.94× higher weighted value due to
long-tail monetization potential.

Cultural Lift Score Example:
When Queen Elizabeth II died (September 8, 2022), "The Crown" viewership surged:
Pre-event (August 2022):
Weekly views: 1.2M
Week-over-week growth: +3%
Post-event (September 2022):
Week 1 after death: 4.8M views (+300%)
Week 2: 3.6M views (+200%)

Franchise momentum declining from 1.28 peak (Loki) to 0.76 (Moon Knight) signals
audience fatigue. ALGO-65.2 uses this to adjust predictions for future MCU titles
downward by 15-20% vs historical franchise performance.

Demographics
ALGO-65.2 now predicts total platform views with demographic breakdown. New
enhancement:
𝑉demo (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡, 𝑑)𝑉total (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡) × 𝑃(𝑑 ∣ 𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡)
Where 𝑃(𝑑 ∣ 𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡)is learned demographic distribution model:
Training data: Nielsen/BARB panel demographics for subset of titles
Model: Probabilistic classifier predicting demographic proportions from content features
(genre, rating, cast demographics)
Output: Age/gender/income breakdown of predicted views
Now enable advertiser targeting decisions while maintaining ALGO-65.2's superior total
view accuracy. Hybrid approach combines accurate totals with estimated demographics.

P a g e 86 | 127

Marketing Spend Integration
New enhancement:
𝑉adjusted (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡)𝑉base (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡) × (1 + 𝛾 × log⁡(Marketing𝑖 + 1))
Where 𝛾is learned elasticity parameter (marketing spend impact on viewership).
Data sources:
Studio press releases (when disclosed)
Advertising tracking services (iSpot.tv, Kantar Media)
Social media ad spend estimates (Facebook Ad Library, YouTube ad frequency)
Benefit: Improves first-week prediction accuracy from current 5.7% MAPE to estimated
3.2% MAPE. Particularly valuable for blockbuster releases where marketing spend highly
variable ($5M to $150M range).

Real-Time Social Sentiment Integration
Incorporates real-time social signals to capture viral dynamics:
𝑉viral (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡)𝑉base (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡) × (1 + 𝛼 × Social Velocity(𝑖, 𝑡))
Where Social Velocity measures rate of social conversation acceleration:
Social Velocity(𝑖, 𝑡)

𝑑2
[Twitter mentions + TikTok views + Reddit posts]
𝑑𝑡 2

Implementation:
Twitter API v2 streaming for real-time mentions
TikTok Research API for hashtag tracking
Reddit API for subreddit activity monitoring
Google Trends API for search volume spikes
Benefit: Reduce blockbuster under-prediction from 4.8% MAPE to estimated 2.1% MAPE by
detecting viral acceleration early (week 1) and updating predictions dynamically.
Use case: "Wednesday" dance challenge on TikTok (13B views) detected in week 1 →
upward revision of Q4 2022 prediction from 187M to 248M views (within 1.6% of actual
252M).

4. REGIONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GLOBAL VIEWING HOURS
4.1 The Global Hours Problem
Platform disclosure pattern creates analytical challenges:
- Netflix Q2 2025: "11.1 billion hours viewed globally"
- Disney+ Q1 2025: "Not disclosed"
- Prime Video: "Included in Prime membership metrics"
Challenge: Abstract data (weather, events) is regionally specific, but platform data is
global. Solution: Algorithmic decomposition using financial disclosures + engagement
modeling.

UK BARB (2.2% MAPE, best performance):
Reason: Most complete and reliable ground truth data from 5,300-household panel
with device-level measurement
Data quality: Gold standard with overnight+7-day consolidated reporting
Sample size: Largest verification set (47,382 titles)
Netflix (2.4% MAPE):
Reason: Public "What We Watched" report provides 18,000+ title viewership for H1
2023
Challenge: Viewership reported in hours, requires minutes-to-views conversion
Strength: High-confidence ground truth for top-performing content
Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+ (2.8-3.1% MAPE):
Reason: Moderate disclosure frequency via earnings calls and investor
presentations
Challenge: Aggregated metrics (total streaming hours, top 10 titles) require
imputation for full catalog
Strength: Regular quarterly updates enable model recalibration
Paramount+ (3.4% MAPE):
Reason: Limited public disclosure, smaller subscriber base creates higher variance
Challenge: Sports content (NFL, soccer) has atypical viewing patterns hard to model

P a g e 94 | 127

Strength: Reality TV and cable content back-catalog well-represented in training
data
Apple TV+ (4.1% MAPE, highest error):
Reason: No official viewership disclosure, smallest catalog creates winner-take-all
dynamics
Challenge: High-budget prestige content has unpredictable viral performance
Limitation: Model systematically under-predicts breakout hits ("Ted Lasso",
"Severance") that leverage Apple ecosystem integration

10. CONCLUSION
The ALGO-95.66 methodology demonstrates several key innovations that advance
streaming viewership prediction:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hybrid Environmental Architecture: Successfully balances content-driven base
predictions with context-aware environmental adjustments
Comprehensive Multi-Domain Data Engineering: Leverages data spanning
meteorological, epidemiological, event calendar, economic, and financial domains
Regional Decomposition Framework: Implements algorithmic distribution of global
platform hours with empirical validation
Robust Black Swan Performance: Maintains 96.7% accuracy during COVID-19 vs
58.8% industry baseline
Platform Scalability with Specificity: Generalizes across 7 platforms while capturing
platform-specific dynamics
Unified Database Cluster V27.66: Four-database architecture (BFD, VIEWERDBX,
SEASON_AGGREGATES, CREATIVE_TALENT) with 100% fc_uid join integrity

Trained on 540,816 unique titles in Database Cluster V27.66 spanning 12 quarters and
validated against multiple ground truth sources, ALGO-95.66 provides production-ready
forecasting capabilities that explicitly account for environmental context. The system's
integration with Scene Intelligence(TM) creates a comprehensive framework spanning
micro-level scene analysis to macro-level viewership prediction.

As streaming platforms continue to dominate entertainment consumption in an
increasingly volatile environmental landscape, accurate context-aware demand
forecasting becomes essential for content strategy, marketing optimization, and business
planning. ALGO-95.66 operating on V27.66 cluster provides a production-ready solution
while establishing a foundation for future research.

The path forward involves hyperlocal weather integration, real-time event discovery, causal
marketing attribution, and neuroscience-informed engagement metrics, collectively
targeting 99.0% accuracy by 2026.

P a g e 114 | 127

P a g e 115 | 127

Implication 2: Temporal Dynamics Genre-Dependent
The 3.1× difference in decay rates (Reality TV λ0.08 vs Horror λ0.25) challenges the
assumption of universal viewership lifecycle curves. Different content types engage
audiences through distinct psychological mechanisms:
Reality TV: Parasocial relationships create sustained engagement
Horror: Fear response diminishes with familiarity, limiting rewatchability
Comedy: Joke/surprise spoilage creates fast decay
Documentary: Educational value maintains baseline
Theoretical contribution: Content consumption is not monolithic behavior. Genre-specific
engagement psychology must inform measurement methodology.
Implication 3: Ensemble Methods Require Data Integrity Foundation
ALGO-G2's sophisticated Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble achieved only 68.4%
accuracy (31.6% MAPE) on contaminated data, while simple post-deduplication
approaches achieved 95.8% accuracy (4.2% MAPE). This demonstrates:
Accuracy𝑓(Data Quality,Model Complexity)
∂Accuracy

∂Accuracy

Where ∂Data Quality ≫ ∂Model Complexityat production scale.
Theoretical contribution: Machine learning research over-emphasizes architectural
innovation vs data quality engineering. Production systems require "data-first, modelsecond" development philosophy.
Implication 4: Hardware Heterogeneity Enables Cost-Efficient Scale
ALGO-65.2's hybrid CPU-GPU architecture achieves 18.2× speedup vs CPU-only (34 min vs
6.2 hours) using commodity hardware ($2,238 investment). This demonstrates:
CPU advantage: Parallel tree building (Random Forest) leverages 32-core AMD architecture
GPU advantage: Gradient computation (XGBoost) leverages 10,240 CUDA cores
Complementary strengths: Neither alone optimal; hybrid maximizes both

P a g e 116 | 127

Theoretical contribution: As ML models scale, heterogeneous compute (CPU+GPU, or
CPU+TPU, or GPU+FPGA) becomes essential for cost-efficient production deployment.
Cloud-only or single-processor approaches leave performance on table.

12. Conclusion and Future Work
12.1 Summary of Contributions
This research presents ALGO-65.2, a breakthrough streaming viewership prediction system
achieving 97.3% accuracy (2.7% MAPE), representing 8.7× improvement over Nielsen,
10.6× improvement over Kantar, and 11.7× improvement over FlixPatrol. The system
surpasses the ITV Studios contract requirement of 95-97% accuracy while providing 94.7%
cost reduction versus traditional measurement approaches.
Key technical contributions:
Hierarchical deduplication framework correctly identifying 1,127,563 unique content items
from 1,435,914 records, eliminating 308,351 false duplicates that were degrading accuracy
by 28.9 percentage points
Platform-specific ensemble models capturing heterogeneous viewing dynamics across
Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and UK BARB, improving
accuracy by 3.6 percentage points vs universal scaling
Genre-specific temporal decay functions with empirically derived parameters (Reality TV
λ0.08, Horror λ0.25) contributing 2.1 percentage points accuracy improvement
Hybrid CPU-GPU architecture enabling 34-minute full-dataset retraining (1.1M titles, 400M
datapoints) through 61-worker Random Forest parallelization on AMD Ryzen 9 + XGBoost
GPU acceleration on NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti
Feature parsimony methodology reducing 240 candidate features to 42 essential features
through systematic VIF analysis, permutation importance testing, and SHAP analysis,
achieving 82% feature reduction with zero accuracy loss
Comprehensive validation against hundreds of thousands of verified viewership records
(BFD_TRUE_DATA.parquet), establishing statistical superiority (p < 0.001) over all
traditional measurement systems

P a g e 117 | 127

Practical impact:
ITV Studios contract: Contract value met with 97.3% accuracy, exceeding 95-97%
requirement
Production deployment: 34-minute retraining enables weekly model updates as new
platform data released
Cost efficiency: $4M 5-year TCO vs $115M Nielsen+Kantar combined, representing $111M
savings
Coverage completeness: 1,127,563 titles vs Nielsen's ~1,000 titles, enabling long-tail
measurement previously impossible
12.2 Future Research Directions
Direction 4: Regional Expansion and Localization
Extend ALGO-65.2 to non-US/UK markets through transfer learning:
Phase 1: EU Markets (France, Germany, Spain, Italy)
Leverage existing US/UK models as base
Fine-tune on regional platform disclosures (Netflix regional reports, local BARB
equivalents)
Add regional features: local language content flags, regional talent popularity, cultural
preferences
Phase 2: APAC Markets (Japan, South Korea, India, Australia)
Higher cultural divergence requires more extensive localization
Incorporate regional content metadata (anime/K-drama specific features)
Platform landscape differs (iQIYI in China, Hotstar in India)
Phase 3: LATAM Markets (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina)
Spanish/Portuguese language content dominance
Telenovela/sports content requires genre-specific modeling
Regional platform strategies (Globoplay in Brazil)

P a g e 118 | 127

Expected benefit: Global coverage enabling multinational streaming strategy analysis.
Estimated regional accuracy: EU 3.2% MAPE, APAC 4.8% MAPE, LATAM 4.1% MAPE (vs
current 4.7-6.8% from pure transfer learning).
Direction 5: Short-Form Video Adaptation
Extend methodology to YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels:
Challenges:
Temporal granularity: Hours/days vs quarters for long-form
Content volume: Millions of creators vs thousands of premium titles
Recommendation dominance: 70% of views from algorithmic recommendations vs 30% for
streaming
Virality dynamics: 0 to 100M views in 48 hours vs gradual accumulation
Proposed approach:
Creator-level modeling (aggregate channel performance) vs title-level
Real-time update cycle (hourly retraining) vs quarterly
Viral detection algorithms (change-point detection, exponential growth identification)
Recommendation system simulation (approximate YouTube/TikTok algorithms)
Expected accuracy: 12-18% MAPE for short-form (vs 2.7% long-form) due to higher
volatility, but still superior to no quantitative forecasting.
Direction 6: Uncertainty Quantification via Conformal Prediction
Current ALGO-65.2 provides point predictions. Enhancement to prediction intervals:
𝑉pred (𝑖, 𝑝, 𝑡) ± 𝜖𝛼
Where 𝜖𝛼 is calibrated prediction interval at confidence level 𝛼(e.g., 95%).

Methodology: Conformal prediction framework:
Train ALGO-65.2 on training set → predictions 𝑉̂train
Compute conformity scores on calibration set: 𝑠𝑖 ∣ 𝑉actual − 𝑉̂pred ∣
For new prediction, compute interval: 𝑉̂ ± 𝑄1−𝛼 ({𝑠𝑖 })where 𝑄is quantile function
P a g e 119 | 127

Expected benefit: Enable risk-adjusted decision making. Licensing negotiation: "Title
predicted 5.0M views ± 0.8M at 95% confidence" vs point estimate "5.0M views" provides
range for risk assessment.
Direction 7: Causal Impact Analysis
Move beyond prediction to causal inference:
Question: What is causal effect of platform promotion on viewership?
Current ALGO-65.2: Observational correlation (promoted titles have +42% views on Netflix)
Causal enhancement:
Propensity score matching to create synthetic control group

P a g e 120 | 127

Difference-in-differences estimation comparing promoted vs unpromoted similar titles
Instrumental variable approach using platform A/B test data (when available)
Output: "Homepage feature causes +37% incremental views (95% CI: +28%, +46%)" vs
correlational "+42% association"
Expected benefit: Enable ROI analysis for platform investments. Disney+ evaluating
"Disney+ Day" promotional campaign: "Investment $X caused $Y incremental viewership"
supports budget allocation decisions.
Direction 8: Integration with Scene Intelligence™ Platform
ALGO-65.2 as foundation for broader Framecore Scene Intelligence™ capabilities:
Layer 1: Viewership Prediction (current ALGO-65.2)
Quarterly total views across platforms
97.3% accuracy, 2-quarter forward predictions

Layer 2: Revenue Estimation
Viewership → Revenue conversion using platform-specific RPV (revenue per view)
Netflix ad-tier: $0.015 RPV
Hulu: $0.042 RPV (higher ad load)
Disney+: $0.009 RPV (emerging ad tier)
Layer 3: Content Valuation
Lifetime value (LTV) estimation: LTV ∑𝑇𝑡1

𝑉(𝑡) × RPV𝑝 × Discount(𝑡)

Licensing deal analysis: Fair value for multi-year exclusive rights
Competitive bidding intelligence: Estimate rival platform willingness-to-pay
Layer 4: Production Optimization
Genre/budget optimization: "Thriller with $40M budget → predicted 12.4M views → ROI 2.8×"
Cast selection: "Lead actor A → +15% views vs actor B" (controlling for other factors)
Release timing: Q4 holiday window vs Q2 summer optimal launch quarter

P a g e 121 | 127

Expected benefit: Complete "data → intelligence → decision" pipeline. Content
creators/studios use Scene Intelligence™ for end-to-end lifecycle optimization from
greenlight to post-release strategy.
12.3 Broader Impact
Industry Transformation:
ALGO-65.2 and Scene Intelligence™ represent potential paradigm shift in entertainment
analytics:
From opaque to transparent: Reduce information asymmetry between platforms (complete
data) and creators (limited data), enabling fairer negotiations and content valuation.
From panel to census: Traditional measurement extrapolates from 0.02-0.04% household
samples. ALGO-65.2 provides complete catalog coverage, democratizing measurement
beyond top 1,000 titles.
From reactive to predictive: Nielsen/BARB report historical viewing 1-4 weeks delayed.
ALGO-65.2 forecasts 2 quarters ahead, enabling proactive decision-making.
From single-source to multi-platform: Fragmented streaming ecosystem (8+ major
platforms) requires cross-platform intelligence. ALGO-65.2's platform-specific models
provide unified framework.
Ethical Considerations:
Transparency: ALGO-65.2 relies on platform disclosures, creating incentive for
transparency. However, could pressure platforms to reduce disclosure if predictions too
accurate (competitive intelligence concern).
Access equity: Sophisticated prediction systems favor well-resourced studios/platforms.
Independent creators lack access, potentially widening competitive advantage gap.
Mitigation: Offer tiered pricing or free tier for independent creators.
Algorithmic gaming: If platforms learn ALGO-65.2 methodology, could manipulate features
to game predictions. Example: Artificial promotion to inflate predicted views for licensing
negotiations. Mitigation: Continuous model updates, proprietary methodology, adversarial
validation.
Privacy: While ALGO-65.2 predicts aggregate platform views (not individual viewing),
demographic disaggregation layer (Future Direction 1) must respect privacy regulations
(GDPR, CCPA). Mitigation: Aggregate-only predictions, no individual-level tracking.
P a g e 122 | 127

12.4 Concluding Remarks
The journey from ALGO-G2's puzzling 31.6% error through the October 20, 2025 sine wave
test revelation to ALGO-65.2's 97.3% accuracy breakthrough demonstrates a fundamental
principle: in machine learning, data integrity precedes architectural sophistication.
The 308,351 false duplicates corrupting ALGO-G2's training set created a ceiling no
amount of model complexity could overcome. The hierarchical deduplication
methodology, inspired by systematic debugging principles, eliminated this contamination
and unlocked the 28.9 percentage point accuracy gain that made the ITV Studios contract
viable.
Beyond the technical achievement, ALGO-65.2 establishes new industry benchmarks:
8.7× improvement over Nielsen challenges 70-year panel-based orthodoxy
43× cost reduction vs UK BARB demonstrates economic viability at scale
1,127× coverage expansion democratizes measurement beyond top-tier content
Real-time updates (34-minute retraining) enable dynamic decision-making
The ITV Studios contract validates commercial viability, but the broader opportunity
extends across the $200B+ streaming industry. As platforms proliferate (15+ major services
in 2025 vs 3 in 2019), centralized measurement becomes increasingly valuable. ALGO-65.2
and Scene Intelligence™ position Framecore to capture this opportunity.
The Claude architecture that inspired ALGO-65.2's name proved instrumental in
breakthrough deduplication methodology. This collaboration between human domain
expertise and AI reasoning capabilities exemplifies productive human-AI partnership:
human creativity identifying the problem space, AI systematically exploring solution space,
human judgment validating and refining results.
As the entertainment industry navigates ongoing transformation from traditional
distribution to streaming-first strategies, accurate viewership intelligence becomes
strategic imperative. ALGO-65.2 provides that intelligence, enabling data-driven decisions
that optimize content investment, maximize audience engagement, and drive business
performance.

P a g e 123 | 127

The algo series evolution—from ALGO-D's 70% accuracy through ALGO-G2's complexity
plateau to ALGO-65.2's breakthrough—demonstrates that progress is not monotonic.
Sometimes, the path forward requires returning to fundamentals: clean data,
parsimonious features, proper validation. ALGO-65.2's success validates this philosophy
and provides blueprint for future entertainment analytics innovation.
